    Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
    Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
    Everything she never had she's showin' off
    Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
    She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
    Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants


    We're only gettin' older, baby
    And I've been thinkin' about it lately
    Does it ever drive you crazy
    Just how fast the night changes?
    Everything that you've ever dreamed of
    Disappearing when you wake up
    But there's nothing to be afraid of
    Even when the night changes
    It will never change me and you


    Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
    He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
    Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
    Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
    She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
    Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants


    We're only gettin' older, baby
    And I've been thinkin' about it lately
    Does it ever drive you crazy
    Just how fast the night changes?
    Everything that you've ever dreamed of
    Disappearing when you wake up
    But there's nothing to be afraid of
    Even when the night changes
    It will never change me and you


    Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
    Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
    Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost


    We're only gettin' older, baby
    And I've been thinkin' about it lately
    Does it ever drive you crazy
    Just how fast the night changes?
    Everything that you've ever dreamed of
    Disappearing when you wake up
    But there's nothing to be afraid of
    Even when the night changes
    It will never change, baby
    It will never change, baby
    It will never change me and you
